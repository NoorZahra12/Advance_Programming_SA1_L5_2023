#decrementing with loop
count=20
#if count is bigger than 1 or equal to 1 then the loop will stop
while count>=1:
    #print the current count number
    print(count)
    #then decrement the current number by 1
    count -= 1
    #then it will go to line 4 and keep looping until the condition is met
